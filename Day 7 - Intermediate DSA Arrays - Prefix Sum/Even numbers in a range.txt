Q6. Even numbers in a range


Problem Description
You are given an array A of length N and Q queries given by the 2D array B of size Q*2. Each query consists of two integers B[i][0] and B[i][1].
For every query, the task is to find the count of even numbers in the range A[B[i][0]â€¦B[i][1]].


Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 105
1 <= Q <= 105
1 <= A[i] <= 109
0 <= B[i][0] <= B[i][1] < N


Input Format
First argument A is an array of integers.
Second argument B is a 2D array of integers.


Output Format
Return an array of integers.


Example Input
Input 1:
A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
B = [   [0,2] 
        [1,4]   ]
Input 2:
A = [2, 1, 8, 3, 9]
B = [   [0,3] 
        [2,4]   ]


Example Output
Output 1:
[1, 2]
Output 2:
[2, 1]


Example Explanation
For Input 1:
The subarray for the first query is [1, 2, 3] which contains 1 even number.
The subarray for the second query is [2, 3, 4, 5] which contains 2 even numbers.
For Input 2:
The subarray for the first query is [2, 1, 8, 3] which contains 2 even numbers.
The subarray for the second query is [8, 3, 9] which contains 1 even number.

Solution

public class Solution 
{
    public int[] solve(int[] A, int[][] B) 
    {
        int l = A.length;
        int l1 = B.length;
        int [] c = new int [l1];
        int count;
        int lI=0,rI=0;
        for(int j=0;j<l1;j++)
        {
            count =0;
            lI= B[j][0];
            rI= B[j][1];
            for(int i=lI; i<=rI;i++)
            {
                if(A[i]%2==0)
                {
                    count++;
                  
                }
                c[j]=count;
            }
        }
        return c;
    }
}
