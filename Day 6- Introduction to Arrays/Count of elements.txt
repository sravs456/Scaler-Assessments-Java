Q1. Count of elements

Problem Description
Given an array A of N integers. Count the number of elements that have at least 1 elements greater than itself.


Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 105
1 <= A[i] <= 109


Input Format
First and only argument is an array of integers A.


Output Format
Return the count of elements.


Example Input
Input 1:
A = [3, 1, 2]
Input 2:
A = [5, 5, 3]


Example Output
Output 1:
2
Output 2:
1


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:
The elements that have at least 1 element greater than itself are 1 and 2
Explanation 2:
The elements that have at least 1 element greater than itself is 3


Solution

public class Solution {
    public int solve(int[] A) {
        int c=0;
        int max=0;
        for(int i=0;i<=A.length-1;i++)
        {
            if(A[i]>max)
            {
                max = A[i];
            }
        }
        for(int i=0;i<=A.length-1;i++)
        {
            if (A[i]!=max)
            {
                c++;
            }
        }
    return c;
    }
}
